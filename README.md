# Ticket Handoff Assistant

> **Turn 30-minute escalations into 3-minute handoffs.**

A secure, privacy-first desktop app that helps IT support engineers create professional ticket escalations with AI-powered summaries, structured checklists, and one-click Jira integration.

---

## Why Use This?

### The Problem
You're an L1 support engineer who needs to escalate a ticket to L2. You've spent 30 minutes troubleshooting, but now you need to:
- Reconstruct what you tried from memory
- Format it nicely for the next team
- Copy/paste ticket details manually
- Hope you didn't forget anything critical

**Result:** 10-15 minutes writing notes + follow-up questions from L2 because something was unclear.

### The Solution
Ticket Handoff Assistant **automates the busywork** so you can focus on solving problems:

✅ **Fetch ticket context automatically** from Jira (summary, reporter, current status)
✅ **Track troubleshooting as you go** with interactive checklists
✅ **Generate AI summaries** of what worked/didn't work (optional, runs locally)
✅ **Post formatted notes to Jira** in one click with markdown formatting
✅ **Save drafts** and resume later if you get interrupted
✅ **Attach files** directly to Jira tickets

**Time savings:** 9 minutes per escalation, 50% fewer clarifying questions from L2.

---

## What You Would Use It For

### Perfect For
- **L1 → L2 escalations** - Handoff tickets with complete context
- **Internal handoffs** - Pass tickets between shifts with clarity
- **Incident documentation** - Track troubleshooting steps in real-time
- **Knowledge building** - Review past escalations to find patterns
- **Training new hires** - Show examples of good escalation notes

### Common Workflows

**Scenario 1: Quick Escalation (3 minutes)**
```
1. Enter ticket ID → App fetches context from Jira
2. Select "General Troubleshooting" template
3. Check off steps you tried: ✓ Cleared cache, ✓ Restarted service
4. Click "Generate Summary" → AI writes: "Attempted standard troubleshooting..."
5. Click "Post to Ticket" → Done ✅
```

**Scenario 2: Build As You Go (30 seconds per step)**
```
While troubleshooting:
- Try something → Add to checklist → Check if it worked
- Get interrupted → Hit Cmd+S to save draft
- Resume later → Pick up exactly where you left off
- Escalate when stuck → Summary is already written
```

**Scenario 3: Attach Evidence**
```
1. Create escalation with checklist
2. Attach screenshot of error, log file, config dump
3. Post → Files upload to Jira automatically
```

## How to Use It

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- macOS 10.15+ (Windows/Linux coming soon)
- [Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) account with API access
- (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for AI summaries

**Install:**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/saagpatel/TicketHandoff.git
cd TicketHandoff

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Run in low-disk lean development mode
npm run lean:dev

# Build production app (creates .dmg installer)
npm run tauri build
```

### Normal Dev vs Lean Dev

- `npm run tauri dev`: fastest repeat startup, but keeps Rust and Vite build artifacts in the repo (`src-tauri/target`, `node_modules/.vite`).
- `npm run lean:dev`: routes Rust/Vite build caches to a temporary directory and removes heavy local build artifacts when the dev session exits.
- Tradeoff: lean mode saves disk space aggressively, but each new session will usually compile more and start slower.

### First-Time Setup

#### 1. Configure Jira Integration
1. Open **Settings** page in the app
2. Generate a Jira API token: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
3. Enter your details:
   - **Jira Base URL:** `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`
   - **Email:** your-email@company.com
   - **API Token:** (paste token)
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify

**Security:** Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain (not the app database), so they're encrypted by the OS.

#### 2. Set Up AI Summaries (Optional)
```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
brew install ollama

# Download a model (llama3 recommended, ~4GB)
ollama pull llama3

# Start Ollama server (runs in background)
ollama serve
```

Then in app Settings:
- **Ollama Endpoint:** `http://localhost:11434` (default)
- **Model:** `llama3`

Click **Test Ollama Connection** to verify.

**Note:** AI is optional. You can create escalations without it—just skip the "Generate Summary" step.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Escalation
```
Ticket: SUPPORT-1234 - "User can't access dashboard"

Your troubleshooting:
☑ Verified user permissions in admin panel

☑ Tested in incognito mode
☐ Checked server logs

Generated summary:
"Attempted standard browser troubleshooting (cache, incognito) with no
improvement. Verified user permissions are correct. Issue persists across
browsers suggesting backend problem. Requires server log review."

Posted to Jira in markdown format with checklist and summary.
Time: 2m 30s
```

### Example 2: Complex Multi-File Escalation
```
Ticket: SUPPORT-5678 - "API returning 500 errors"

Your troubleshooting:
☑ Captured error screenshot
☑ Downloaded server logs (large file)
☑ Exported recent API requests from monitoring tool
☑ Identified spike in traffic at error time

Actions:
1. Add checklist items as you investigate
2. Attach 3 files (screenshot, logs, export)
3. Generate summary: "Traffic spike coincided with errors..."
4. Review → Post → All files upload automatically

Time: 4 minutes (vs 15 minutes manual copy/paste/upload)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not fetch ticket from Jira"
**Symptoms:** Error when clicking "Fetch from Jira"
**Fixes:**
- Verify ticket ID format: `PROJECT-1234` (not just `1234`)
- Check Jira URL in Settings (must be `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
- Regenerate API token if it expired: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
- Click "Test Connection" in Settings to diagnose

### "Ollama not available"
**Symptoms:** Generate Summary button shows warning
**Fixes:**
- Start Ollama: `ollama serve` in terminal
- Verify model is installed: `ollama list` (should show `llama3`)
- Check endpoint in Settings: `http://localhost:11434`
- **You can still create escalations without AI** - just write summary manually

### "Failed to attach file to Jira"
**Symptoms:** Comment posts but file upload fails
**Fixes:**
- Check file size (must be < 100MB)
- Verify file path still exists (didn't move/delete it)
- Check Jira permissions (can you attach files in Jira web UI?)
- Large files may timeout on slow connections (try smaller file or better network)

### "Database initialization failed"
**Symptoms:** App won't start
**Fixes:**
- Check disk permissions: App needs write access to `~/Library/Application Support/com.tickethandoff.desktop/`
- Free up disk space if drive is full
- Restart app (connection pooling will retry)

### General Debugging
- Check **Activity Log** in History page for detailed error messages
- Enable debug logging: `RUST_LOG=debug npm run tauri dev`
- Report issues: https://github.com/saagpatel/TicketHandoff/issues

## Development

### Dev Modes and Cleanup
```bash
# Standard local dev (faster warm restarts, higher disk use)
npm run tauri dev

# Lean local dev (lower disk use, slower cold starts)
npm run lean:dev

# Remove heavy build artifacts only (safe daily cleanup)
npm run clean:heavy

# Remove all reproducible local caches including dependencies
npm run clean:full
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Frontend tests (Vitest)
npm test

# Frontend tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Frontend test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Backend tests (Rust)
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Lint frontend
npm run lint

# Format Rust code
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt

# Check Rust code
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build optimized app bundle
npm run tauri build

# Output:
# - macOS: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Ticket Handoff Assistant_*.dmg
# - Windows: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Ticket Handoff Assistant_*.msi
# - Linux: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/ticket-handoff_*.AppImage
